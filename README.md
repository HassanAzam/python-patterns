        - Singleton: This pattern restrict the number of instance of a class to one object.
        
        - Factory: It provides an a way to create objects without exposing object creation logic.
        
        - Builder: It eases the process of creating a complex object, by combining different simple            objects in a specifc pattern. Builder class buils the final object. Builder                 class is independent of other objects.

        - Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent                          objects without specifying their concrete classes.

        - Prototype: Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
                     and create new objects by copying this prototype.
